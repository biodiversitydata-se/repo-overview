# SBDI repo overview

The [Swedish Biodiversity Data Infrastructure](https://biodiversitydata.se/) is developed in collaboration with the [Living Atlas Community](https://living-atlases.gbif.org/), and aims to make Swedish biodiversity data accessible for innovative and interdisciplinary research on biodiversity and ecosystems. Formally launching in 2021, SBDI is a collaboration between eleven consortium partners, and will include a variety of tools and open-source software projects. Although most of these will be found under [biodiversitydata-se](https://github.com/biodiversitydata-se/), some will remain hosted by partner organizations. We provide a list of these external repos, and also group (internal or external) repos according to a few SBDI themes, below.

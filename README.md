# SBDI repo overview
The [Swedish Biodiversity Data Infrastructure (SBDI)](https://biodiversitydata.se/) is a collaboration between eleven consortium partners, and will aggregate a variety of tools and open-source software projects. Although most of these will be developed or forked under [biodiversitydata-se](https://github.com/biodiversitydata-se/), some will be hosted by partner organizations or external collaborators. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of SBDI-related repos below:

## Repos hosted elsewhere
The following repos are hosted by SBDI consortium partners or external collaborators:

* [nf-core/ampliseq](https://github.com/nf-core/ampliseq) -
16S rRNA amplicon sequencing analysis workflow using QIIME2.

* [plankton-toolbox](https://github.com/planktontoolbox/plankton-toolbox) -
Free tool for phyto- and zooplankton.

## Repos grouped by theme 
Internal and external SBDI repos can be loosely grouped into the following, non-mutually exclusive categories:
* [ALA forks](#ala-forks)
* [Archeological data](#archeological)
* [Courses and workshops](#courses)
* [Marine data](#marine)
* [Molecular data](#molecular)
* [R](#r)
* [SBDI information and discussion](#sbdi-info)
* [Support](#support)
* [Systematic monitoring](#systematic)

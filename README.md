# SBDI repo overview

The [Swedish Biodiversity Data Infrastructure (SBDI)](https://biodiversitydata.se/) is developed in collaboration with the [Living Atlas Community](https://living-atlases.gbif.org/), and aims to make Swedish biodiversity data accessible for innovative and interdisciplinary research on biodiversity and ecosystems. Formally launching in 2021, SBDI is a collaboration between eleven consortium partners, and will aggregate a variety of tools and open-source software projects. Although most of these will be developed and found under [biodiversitydata-se](https://github.com/biodiversitydata-se/), some will be hosted by partner organizations or external collaborators. We list these external repos, and also group (internal or external) repos according to a few SBDI themes, below.

## Repos hosted by SBDI partners or external collaborators
The following repos are hosted by SBDI consortium partners or external collaborators.
